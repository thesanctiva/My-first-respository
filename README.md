# My-first-respository DSA DOCUMENTATION!!

This is where I started my Portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with Digital SkillUP Africa.

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from MS Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: Finance Analysis; A financial analysis project using SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

### Project Overview 
This project is focused on analyzing personal and organizational financial data using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**. It combines data management, processing, and visual storytelling to uncover patterns in spending, income, budgeting, and forecasting.

## 📊 Data Source Summary

This project uses a **synthetically generated financial dataset** containing **5,000 transactions** of both **income** and **expenses**. The dataset is designed to simulate realistic personal or small-business financial activity over time.

### ✨ Key Features:
- **Date Range:** Covers over 1.5 years of financial activity  
- **Types of Records:** Income (e.g., Salary, Freelance, Investments) and Expenses (e.g., Rent, Groceries, Utilities)  
- **Fields Included:**
  - `Date`
  - `Description` (e.g., "Monthly Salary", "Supermarket", "Electricity Bill")
  - `Category` (e.g., Salary, Groceries, Utilities)
  - `Type` (Income or Expense)
  - `Amount`
  - `Payment Method` (e.g., Bank Transfer, Debit Card)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL Server**: For storing, managing, and querying the financial data efficiently using SQL.
- **Microsoft Excel**: To create, view, and manipulate raw financial data and perform initial exploratory analysis. [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    - For Data Collection
    - For Data Cleaning
       1. Data Manipulation
       2. Data Munching
      
- **Power BI**: To build interactive and insightful dashboards that visualize financial trends and summaries. [For creating a report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
- **MS Power Point**: For Presentation.

  ## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation Summary

Before analysis, the financial dataset undergoes thorough cleaning and preparation to ensure accuracy and usability:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Checked for and filled or removed any missing data points to maintain data integrity.
- **Data Type Consistency:** Ensured that dates are in proper date format, amounts are numeric, and categorical fields are standardized.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Eliminated any duplicate records to avoid skewing results.
- **Normalization:** Standardized category and description names for consistency across the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and reviewed unusually high or low amounts to verify data validity.
- **Data Transformation:** Created new fields such as month, quarter, or year extracted from the date for easier time-based analysis.

These steps enable reliable, efficient, and insightful financial analysis throughout the project.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the underlying patterns and quality of the financial dataset:

- **Summary Statistics:** Calculated mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for income and expense amounts to grasp data distribution.
- **Category Breakdown:** Analyzed the frequency and total amounts by category to identify major sources of income and expense.
- **Time Series Trends:** Visualized monthly and quarterly income and expenses to detect seasonality and trends over time.
- **Payment Method Usage:** Examined the distribution of transactions across different payment methods.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Checked relationships between variables, such as amount vs. category or type, to identify interesting patterns.
- **Data Visualization:** Used charts like histograms, bar charts, and line graphs in Excel and Power BI to gain insights and guide further analysis.

This foundational analysis informs the design of dashboards and deeper statistical models within the project.
